      <h2>How did this all start?</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up with very minimal electronics and mainly got my intertainment from outdoor activities untill i got my first xbox 360 at the age of 16. I will admit I was extremely addicted. There would be nights that I would be up until 3am playing. im sure im not the first boy to like games that much at that age considering that all my friends were just as addicted.

      <h2>The pursuasion I wont regret.</h2>
      <p>
        I had already known my friend steven had built a pc and that was mainly because he would hardly ever play on xbox with me. I did'nt worry about it too much because i did have alot of other friends on xbox still. It seemed at the time that switching to building a pc and gaming on that was becoming a big thing. I remember there were occasional times when steven would play on xbox again for short times to try and convince me to build a gaming pc. He would always mention how much faster, easier, and over all better it was but I typically blew him off because pc gaming was very expensve.

      <h2>The final switch</h2>
      <p>
        Being around the age that I was I was very stubborn and would often not change my mind even if i knew I was wrong. I still did not want to switch to pc, that is untill I used Stevens computer. From there on out I knew within ten minutes of playing that I wanted a gaming pc. Of course, another downfall of being you is that you often dont have much money for any at all. I did have a job but it was part time so I knew i was not good at saving money so I had to come up with a plan. The only way for me to commit was buy it piece by piece and untill i had all the required components. It took me about a year to finish it to where i could play and I was more than happy that i had switched, but I did'nt stop there. I got sort of obsessed with not only pc gaming but the look and feel of it. So, here I am 6000 dollars later, and about 5 years later. I have my monster rig of a gaming pc and I love it.

        <h1>Why exactly is pc gaming better than console (xbox, ps4, ect.)?</h1>
        <p>
          Antonio Villas-Boas, a tech insider that posts on the business insider website, describes 10 different reasons backing this argument. A few of his arguments are related to graphics and game pruchase pricing. He displays that purchasing pc games is often cheaper and come packed with a better visual expierence due to the more powerful machine you're using.
